## Text translation

We use Facebook's open source project [NLLB](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb). AI breakthrough project that open-sources models capable of delivering high-quality translations directly between any pair of 200+ languages â€” including low-resource languages like Asturian, Luganda, Urdu and more. It aims to help people communicate with anyone, anywhere, regardless of their language preferences.
